# OURS Project - DIY Smartphone

## MISSION:

I wanted to give people more options and control over their most personal device, so I created an Open-source, Upgradable, Repairable Smartphone, that is also completely free of Big Tech. It's not theirs, it's O.U.R.S. 

Below are the complete hardware and software instructions to build your own OURphone. Please enjoy, upgrade, tinker, improve and evolve my original design as you see fit, and share your upgrades here. Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/boyofthefuture/) if you have any questions / ideas.


## SPECS LIST

- 4G LTE internet
- Call, SMS, Contacts book
- Quad Core 1.2GHz Broadcom BCM2837 64bit CPU
- 1 GB RAM
- 4 inch 480 x 800 colour touch screen
- 5MP colour camera
- GPS
- Wifi
- Bluetooth audio
- 1 watt onboard audio speaker
- 3 USB ports
- HDMI port to plug in external monitor


## GUIDING PRINCIPLES

- Low cost, off-the-shelf electronic components
- Less soldering / destroying, more connecting / assembling
- Share everything required to replicate
- Modular, standardised parts


## IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE

- Use a faster Raspberry Pi with more RAM
- Use a capacitative touch screen, not resistive touch
- A bigger screen would be nice
- Eliminate audio whining / cracking (I think this is an RPi 3 problem, or audio amp needs isolation)
- Add a microphone / USB audio card to enable audio on video recordings
- Connect phone call audio into Bluetooth (not just device audio)
- Audio jack
- Make less brick-like
- Customise Raspbian so the UI is more usable by finger (perhaps flash another OS)
- Indicate remaining battery life


## HOW TO BUILD

Buy all the parts in parts list.xml.

You can snap together a working version quite quickly with just the following:
- Raspberry Pi
- 4G HAT + GSM and GPS antennas
- Raspberry Pi power supply
- Waveshare touchscreen
- Raspberry Pi camera (optional)
- Headphones with built-in mic

Follow the instructions listed in setup_commands.txt to ready the Raspberry Pi, setup internet, and get the phone.py app working.
